## site.pp ##

# This file (/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/manifests/site.pp) is the main entry point
# used when an agent connects to a master and asks for an updated configuration.
#
# Global objects like filebuckets and resource defaults should go in this file,
# as should the default node definition. (The default node can be omitted
# if you use the console and don't define any other nodes in site.pp. See
# http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/language_guide.html#nodes for more on
# node definitions.)

## Active Configurations ##
## run with bundle exec puppet apply --verbose --modulepath=site:modules --hiera_config=hiera.yaml manifests/site.pp

# Disable filebucket by default for all File resources:
#http://docs.puppetlabs.com/pe/latest/release_notes.html#filebucket-resource-no-longer-created-by-default
File { backup => false }

# enable the Puppet 4 behavior today
#
Package {
  allow_virtual => true,
}

# Ensure we have a path set for all possible execs
# This is now limited to unixoid systems
Exec {
  path => '/usr/bin:/usr/sbin/:/bin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin',
}

# DEFAULT NODE
# Node definitions in this file are merged with node data from the console. See
# http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/language_guide.html#nodes for more on
# node definitions.

# The default node definition matches any node lacking a more specific node
# definition. If there are no other nodes in this file, classes declared here
# will be included in every node's catalog, *in addition* to any classes
# specified in the console for that node.
node default {
  # This is where you can declare dynamic classes for all nodes.
  include ::common::packages
  include ::cloudwatch
}
